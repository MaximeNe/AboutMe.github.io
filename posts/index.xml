    <description><![CDATA[What is this challenge about? This is an artificial intelligence challenge organized jointly by Neovision and Ens&rsquo;IA. For the second edition of this challenge, participants had to create an AI, but don&rsquo;t panic: Neovision coaches will were there to accompany them. There were also workshops to give them additional knowledge!
This challenge were for participants the opportunity to live a real AI project and to deepen their knowledge, but also and above all to have fun and to meet people]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[What is the project about ? The goal is to build in Java a compiler with no default for a language called Deca (Java like language)
The compilation process is divided into 3 steps :
 The syntax analysis (Lexer and Parser)  input : source program output : primitive abstract tree   The contextual verification  input : primitive abstract tree output : abstract tree decorated   The code generation for an abstract machine  input : abstract tree decorated output : assembly program    Finally, the project is also composed of a theme of our choice.]]></description>

The sales are based auction mode:
 Users make increasing bids on available products and the 5th bid wins. The auction mode is not important, it can should changed easily, and is not known by Gange&rsquo;s customers. The products are categorized and and a recommendation mode should be implemented.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[The project With two teamates, we implemented 5 different multi-agent simulators using only java.
Every simulator we implemented is using an event manager to handle the execution of the next step of the simulation.

    <description><![CDATA[VirtualDragAndDrop I was kind of bored a week end so I wanted to do something that will be absolutely never used again 🙃.
This little project allowed me to get in touch with OpenCV and image processing.
The program I built creates a virtual drag and drop on objects represented by their centers. I used rectangle for this example.
To use the program, just run the file main.py. Then to move an object, you have to &ldquo;grab it&rdquo; = close your hand when your hand is on the object.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[The challenge: This challenge was organized by Ens&rsquo;IA and Neovision in 2021. It lasted a month and a half and was about the well known subject of Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
What is OCR ?  It&rsquo;s about converting images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text. Learn more   ➡️ The goal was quite simple but still very challenging:
building the best model to recognize the characters in the dataset given by Neovision.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[The project This project is about building from scratch a functional JPEG to PPM decoder. I teamed up with 2 other students to build the decoder using C.
How it works JPEG format compress images using mathematical methods and algorithms that are described on the official JPEG documentation.

    <description><![CDATA[The project  Considering a set of points $p_i$, $1 \le i \le n$, and a limit distance $s$, we want to know the number a connex component of the given set of points and distance.
Two vertices $p_i$ and $p_j$ are linked by an edge if $d(p_i, p_j) \le s$. A connex component is a sub-graph where all the vertices are linked by transitivity.  A solution I worked in pair with Hugo on different methods.]]></description>
