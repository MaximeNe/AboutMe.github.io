    <description><![CDATA[The game Blobwar is played on an 8x8 chessboard where two players (blue and red) compete. Each player has a set of pieces called blobs. The game is played turn by turn. Each turn, whenever possible, the current player chooses a blob and moves it. Any move to an adjacent square (including diagonally) sees the blob duplicated on the target square. It is also possible to jump to a distance of 2 squares, but in this case the blob moves from the starting square to the target square (so there is no duplication).]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[What is this challenge about? This is an artificial intelligence challenge organized jointly by Neovision and Ens&rsquo;IA. For the second edition of this challenge, participants had to create an AI, but don&rsquo;t panic: Neovision coaches will were there to accompany them. There were also workshops to give them additional knowledge!
This challenge were for participants the opportunity to live a real AI project and to deepen their knowledge, but also and above all to have fun and to meet people]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[VirtualDragAndDrop I was kind of bored a week end so I wanted to do something that will be absolutely never used again 🙃.
This little project allowed me to get in touch with OpenCV and image processing.
The program I built creates a virtual drag and drop on objects represented by their centers. I used rectangle for this example.
To use the program, just run the file main.py. Then to move an object, you have to &ldquo;grab it&rdquo; = close your hand when your hand is on the object.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[The challenge: This challenge was organized by Ens&rsquo;IA and Neovision in 2021. It lasted a month and a half and was about the well known subject of Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
What is OCR ?  It&rsquo;s about converting images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text. Learn more   ➡️ The goal was quite simple but still very challenging:
building the best model to recognize the characters in the dataset given by Neovision.]]></description>
